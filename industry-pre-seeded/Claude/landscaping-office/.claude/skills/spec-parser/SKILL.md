# Spec Parser

## Journal layer

Do not create a second tree. `continue` copies `journals/work-items/_TEMPLATE/`. A blocking question becomes a map node through journal-keeper and becomes the active leaf. Its id is unique and is not `work-item` or a phase name. Use AskUserQuestion for a fixed choice and chat for an open answer.

Parses the project specification, extracts requirements, validates, and lists assumptions and open questions. Use when starting the project, when the user points to a spec file, or when the spec has changed and must be re-parsed.

## When to use

- User says "start", "implement from spec", or points to a requirements/spec file
- Pipeline is at spec phase or journal says next action is "run spec-parser"
- User indicates the spec has changed and must be re-parsed

## Workflow-Aware Behavior

This skill adjusts artifact paths and questions based on workflow type:

**Developer workflow:**
- Artifact path: `work-items/<id>/docs/design/requirements-summary.md`
- Standard requirement questions

**Production Incident workflow:**
- Artifact path: `work-items/<id>/docs/incident/assessment.md`
- Additional questions:
  - "What is the incident scope? (Datacenter, DB, CustomerID)"
  - "Are there customer escalations? Which customers?"
  - "What dashboards show the issue? (DBHS, SLO Tracker, logs and monitoring)"
  - "What is the rollback count?"

## Instructions

### 0. Work Item context

- Active work item: the line in `.claude/active-context.txt`, formatted `work-item:<id>`.
- Artifacts (spec, docs, TODOS, STATUS, facts): `work-items/<id>/`.
- Journal: `journals/work-items/<id>/progress.md` for item-wide fields, `state.json` for the
  branch map, and `nodes/<active leaf>.md` for step notes, open questions, and the next action.
  Write through journal-keeper.

## Spec Q&A Session Example

When conducting a spec Q&A session to create spec.md, follow this structured approach:

**Step 1: Problem Statement**
- "What problem are you trying to solve?"
- "Who is affected by this problem?"

**Step 2: Solution Overview**
- "What solution do you envision?"
- "What are the key capabilities/features needed?"

**Step 3: Users & Stakeholders**
- "Who will use this?"
- "Are there different user roles?"

**Step 4: Constraints**
- "Are there technology constraints? (e.g., must use .NET, Python, cloud platform)"
- "Are there timeline or budget constraints?"
- "Any compliance or security requirements?"

**Step 5: Success Criteria**
- "How will you know this is successful?"
- "What metrics or outcomes define success?"

**Step 6: Scope Boundaries**
- "What is explicitly out of scope?"
- "What can be deferred to future phases?"

**Step 7: Dependencies**
- "Are there external systems to integrate with?"
- "Any third-party services or APIs?"
- "Any existing codebases or data sources?"

After gathering answers, synthesize into a structured spec.md with sections:
- Problem Statement
- Solution Overview
- Users & Stakeholders
- Requirements (Functional & Non-Functional)
- Constraints
- Success Criteria
- Out of Scope
- Dependencies & Integrations
- Assumptions
