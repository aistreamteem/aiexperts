# Memory System Index

Quick navigation for this **Medical clinic front role** expert. Load shared memory for role work. Do not load developer or incident-response files for this role — they are not the live memory.

---

## Two axes: Workflow (browsing) and Triggers (action)

1. **Workflow axis** (this file) — which shared entries apply to the current registered role job (`**Workflows:** all` or a registry id).

2. **Trigger axis** ([TRIGGER-INDEX.md](TRIGGER-INDEX.md)) — action-time surfacing. The PreToolUse hook `.cursor/hooks/inject_rules_on_action.py` reads `trigger-index.json`. Most clinic-role rules use `Triggers: none` (judgment / ask). Regenerate with `python scripts/memory/build_trigger_index.py` after retagging a rule.

## Quick navigation

### Shared (this role)

**When to use:** Any medical-clinic front-role Work Item (day list, eligibility screenshot, intake, wait list, recall, referral, records release, no-show, day close).

**Load these files:**

- [facts-shared.md](facts-shared.md) — day lists, eligibility as dated screenshots, intake completeness, referrals, ROI, no-shows, tender close, starter clinic notes
- [rules-shared.md](rules-shared.md) — never diagnose, never promise coverage, quote dated sources only, one Work Item one folder, label guesses

**Typical jobs:** see `.cursor/workflows/workflow-registry.json` and `docs/role/work-item-method.md`.

## Usage

1. Always load this index first.
2. Load `facts-shared.md` + `rules-shared.md`.
3. Load the active Work Item `facts/` and `rules/` if present.
4. Filter Expert Role entries to `all` or the current registry id.

**Maintenance:** New shop knowledge goes in the shared pair. If a new high-value scenario appears (5+ similar questions), add a line here.

## Pre-seeded role

**Role title:** Medical clinic front role (not the clinician)

**Seed id:** `medical-clinic-front-role`

Day-to-day role memory is the **shared** pair above. Starter entries are typical US medical-clinic front-role practice until the operator corrects them.
